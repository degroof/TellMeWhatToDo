Tell Me What To Do is an anti-todo list. 

Instead of giving you a list of tasks to choose from, it randomly selects a single task from the list of available ones. Once given a task, you must complete it before you can get another.

The idea is to help relieve decision fatigue from being confronted with a long list of tasks. Hopefully, if you're presented with one task at time, you're much less likely to be overwhelmed by the number of the number of things to do.

Features include:
- assigning a priority to a task (higher priority tasks are more likely to come up first)
- tasks can be one-off or repeating (hours, day, weeks, months, years)
- one-off tasks are done when completed, but can be requed as needed
- repeating tasks can be set for a specific time, day and/or month
- tasks can be dependent on other tasks (they won't queue until their dependencies are completed)
- hourly tasks can be limited to a time range (e.g. 6am to 6pm)
- daily tasks can be set to a specific time of day or "whenever"
- weekly tasks can be set to a specific day of the week and/or time of day
- monthly tasks can be set to a specific day of the month (including "last day") and/or time of day
- yearly tasks can be set to month, day and/or time

**NOTE:** Just because a task is scheduled for a specific time, it doesn't mean you'll be notified at that time. The task will be queued at that time but may not come up until it's randomly selected from the pool of available tasks.
